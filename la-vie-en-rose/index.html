  <meta name="description" content="The pounding on the apartment door was loud and impatient. &ldquo;Myoui! Open up! We need to talk about those photos before the agency terminates your contract!&rdquo; the manager&rsquo;s voice came through, muffled but sharp with anger.
Inside, Myoui flinched. He stood in the middle of the room, face pale, his eyes darting between the door and Ludwig. His fear of the outside world was still very real.
&ldquo;Loui, he&rsquo;s there. He&rsquo;s going to take me away,&rdquo; Myoui whispered, panicked.
Ludwig slowly pushed his chair back from the desk. He didn&rsquo;t look bothered at all. Instead of getting up to open the door, he simply looked at Myoui and patted his lap with a slow, absolute gesture. &ldquo;Come here,&rdquo; Ludwig commanded. His voice was low and calm, a stark contrast to the noise outside.
Without a word, Myoui approached. He sat on Ludwig&rsquo;s lap, wrapping his arms around the man&rsquo;s neck as if Ludwig were the only shield in a collapsing world. Ludwig wrapped one arm around Myoui&rsquo;s waist, pulling him closer until Myoui could feel his steady heartbeat.
&ldquo;Stay here. Don&rsquo;t make a sound,&rdquo; Ludwig murmured into Myoui&rsquo;s ear.
Ludwig reached for his phone, pressing a button linked to the apartment&rsquo;s intercom system. His voice echoed directly into the hallway, cold and sharp as a blade.
&ldquo;Leave this floor in ten seconds, or I will leak your agency&rsquo;s internal logs regarding last year&rsquo;s tax embezzlement to the public.&rdquo; Ludwig said, getting straight to the point. An immediate silence followed outside. The pounding stopped.
&ldquo;Who is this?! Where is Myoui?!&rdquo; the manager shouted, his voice now trembling.
&ldquo;Myoui isn&rsquo;t available. He&rsquo;s busy being mine,&rdquo; Ludwig answered with a tone that was almost bored. &ldquo;Eight seconds left, and it&rsquo;ll be your career that burns, not his. Choose.&rdquo;
It only took three seconds to hear hurried footsteps retreating from the door. Ludwig cut the intercom, then turned his focus back to Myoui, who was still shaking in his lap. He rubbed Myoui&rsquo;s back gently. A rare gesture that finally allowed Myoui to let out a breath of relief.
&ldquo;See? He&rsquo;s gone,&rdquo; Ludwig whispered, kissing Myoui&rsquo;s temple. &ldquo;No agency, no manager, no fans. Just you here, in my lap. Now, stay quiet and let me finish my work.&rdquo;
Myoui hid his face in the crook of Ludwig&rsquo;s neck, feeling so small yet so incredibly safe. He didn&rsquo;t care about his million-dollar contracts anymore. Here, in this spot, he finally had an owner who would never let him go.
One captures the eyes of millions, the other captures the heart of the only one who matters. — Faithfully, Calder &amp; Myoui.
