          &lt;p&gt;This archive contains the duality of our existence. On one side, the raw, unfiltered messages of two souls finding home. On the other, the intercepted threats and sasaeng logs that were silenced before they could reach the light.

          &lt;p&gt;Freedom is rarely handed over with a smile; it must be extracted with surgical precision. They thought they owned every breath Myoui took, every smile he gave to the camera, and every second of his waking life. They were wrong.

This folder contains the tactical weaponry that finally severed the parasitic bond between a star and his agency. It is a history of corporate greed met with a hacker&#39;s cold, calculating justice. From the meticulously gathered dossiers of internal tax embezzlement to the recorded logs of management malpractice, these files are the leverage that turned the hunters into the hunted.

_Legal Weight: Absolute. This data remains the ultimate ultimatum._

          &lt;p&gt;The world gets the pose, the expensive lighting, and the manufactured facade of a perfect model. They see the version of Myoui that has been edited, filtered, and sold for profit. But here, lies the &#39;unreleased cut&#39;. The moments that were never meant for the cameras or the magazine covers. This is the reality of a life lived behind closed curtains, where the only audience that matters is the one person holding the lens.
